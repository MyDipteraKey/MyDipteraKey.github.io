		<p align="center">My intention is to use this site as a starting point when it comes to Diptera identification. 
		I have tried to gather available documents and images from the Internet (free, with no copyright-violation), 
		and to combine them with my own images into a more up-to-date and easy editable identification key. 
		<br><br>
		Any contribution with keys, information, images will be appreciated.
		<br><br>
		If anyone find their documents or images on this site and want them removed, please contact me at skrylten(at)gmail(dot)com, and I will remove them ASAP.
		<br><br>
		Enjoy !
